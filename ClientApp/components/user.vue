            <span class="quote">â€œ</span> Since Rachael is pretty much only working with CBRE, there isn't much chance for feedback, but working
                with Rachael has been awesome! She 's super knowledgeable, approachable and always willing to help - just
                a nice person who does a great job. When I found out I'd be transferring away from CBRE, my first though
                was "but then I won't be able to work with Rachael anymore!" </p>
